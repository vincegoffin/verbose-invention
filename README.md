# verbose-invention
Repository of early 21st century belgian prose, placed here for the world to see and to be archived in the Arctic Code Vault.

# Purpose

This is the repository of all the things I've written in poetry and prose, to be archived and remembered. Dates are linked to my best judgement where applicable (almost nowhere) and date of last modified file where I found them. 

That being said, pull requests are welcome :)

All text are in markdown, with two extra spaces at the end of each line in order to force a carriage return and title as a level 1 (# Title) header, one text per file.
