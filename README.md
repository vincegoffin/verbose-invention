# verbose-invention
Repository of early XIXth century belgian prose, to be archived in the vault.

# Purpose

This is the repository of all the things I've written in poetry and prose, to be archived and remembered. Dates are linked to my best judgement where applicable (almost nowhere) and date of last modified file where I found them.
